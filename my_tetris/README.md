## Task
Create a simple Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implement basic game mechanics such as piece movement, rotation, and scoring. Additionally, include functionality for pausing and resuming the game.

Description
This project consists of a basic implementation of the classic Tetris game. The game canvas is rendered using HTML5's <canvas> element, and the logic is implemented in JavaScript. The game features different Tetris pieces, each represented by a unique color and shape. Players can move, rotate, and drop pieces to clear lines and earn points.

The game includes the following features:

Piece Movement: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the Tetris piece horizontally. The down arrow key accelerates the piece's descent.

Piece Rotation: Rotate the Tetris piece clockwise using the up arrow key. For counterclockwise rotation, press the "Q" key.

Force Down: Press the spacebar to instantly drop the Tetris piece to the bottom.

Pause/Resume: Press the "P" key to pause and resume the game.

Scoring: Earn points by clearing lines. The score is displayed on the screen.
