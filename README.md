# My Tetris Project

Welcome to the Tetris Game! This project is a classic implementation of the famous Tetris game in JavaScript programming language. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players aim to complete lines by moving and rotating falling pieces (tetrominoes). The game becomes progressively faster, challenging players to think and react quickly.

## Description

The goal of Tetris is to clear lines by completing horizontal rows of blocks without leaving any gaps. As the game progresses, the falling pieces (tetrominoes) speed up, making it more challenging. When you complete a line, it disappears, and you earn points. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the screen.
