What is the problem? And where is the challenge?


The problem is to create a Tetris implementation using JavaScript. The challenge lies in implementing the game logic, handling user input for controlling the tetrominoes, 

rendering the game on a canvas, and adhering to the given specifications and guidelines.

## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?
How have you solved the problem?

I haven't personally solved the problem as I am an AI language model. However, to solve the problem, you would need to create multiple JavaScript files such as a controller, renderer, and tetris_logic. You would also need to implement the game mechanics, handle user input for controlling the tetrominoes, manage the game state, and render the game on a canvas. Following the given specifications and guidelines,

 including the Tetris logo, sound effects, scoring system, and other features, would be part of the solution.

The instructions provided suggest setting up a basic HTTP server to serve the index.html file. Here's an example of how to install and run the HTML server:

Create a file called html_server.js with the provided content.
Create an empty index.html file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the html_server.js and index.html files are located.
Run the command node html_server.js to start the HTML server.
The server will be accessible at the URL mentioned in the console output, replacing XXXXXXXXX with your workspace ID.


## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
How does it work?
The Tetris implementation works by creating a game environment with a playfield, where tetrominoes (falling blocks) are controlled by the player using arrow keys or other specified controls. The objective is to manipulate the tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear and give the player points. The game continues until the playfield reaches the top, indicating game over. The implementation involves handling user input, updating the game state, checking for collisions, rendering the game on a canvas, applying the Tetris guidelines and specifications, 

and providing features like hold piece, sound effects, scoring, levels, and more.
