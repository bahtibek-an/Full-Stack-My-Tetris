# Tetris Game

This is a simple Tetris game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project implements the classic Tetris game where players control falling blocks known as Tetrominoes. The objective is to complete horizontal lines by filling them with blocks without leaving any gaps. When a line is completed, it clears from the board, and the player earns points. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the playing area.

3. Use the down arrow key to speed up the descent of the Tetrominoes.
